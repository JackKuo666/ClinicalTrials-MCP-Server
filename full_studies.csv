NCT05532995,Responses to CPET in Subjects With Persistent Exercise Intolerance After COVID-19: an Open-Source Exercise Network,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05532995,,COMPLETED,"This retrospective collaborative study on persistent exercise intolerance after COVID-19 offers to perform a large descriptive analysis of CPET performed in real-life by pulmonologists, cardiologists and physiologists. Indeed, these practicians are regularly consulted for a persistent intolerance to exercise expressed by dyspnea and/or frank fatigability sometimes associated with muscular or thoracic pain. When these complaints persist beyond 3 months after the first symptoms, it is legitimate to perform a CPET:* Either to evaluate the functional impact of an identified organ deficiency (e.g. myocarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, etc.),* Or, in the absence of formal arguments for an identified organ deficiency, to observe possible abnormalities in physiological responses during an incremental exercise test, likely to explain the persistence of symptoms and intolerance to exercise. Indeed, the recent literature highlights the presence of non-specific ventilatory and cardio-circulatory abnormalities leading to various physio-pathological observations. Unfortunately, these reports now concern relatively small numbers of patients with very diverse clinical forms of Covid, comorbidities and habitus.In order to improve the understanding of persistent symptoms and in particular the diversity of physiological response presentations, the investigators propose to collect a very large amount of data through a web-based platform designed to collect the measurements made throughout the exercise test directly from the ergospirometer.The relevant data covers the period from January 2, 2020 to December 31, 2022 (i.e. 35 months), The retrospective data collection will be carried out from February 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023.The descriptive analysis will focus on the kinetics of all the variables measured and calculated on subgroups defined a priori on age, sex, comorbidities, acute covid severity, persistent symptoms post covid, regular habitual physical activity level, etc. according to the sample.The study is expected to collect data from around 1000 patients and to involve around 40 French-speaking investigators. However, this collaborative study is open on request to all centers wishing to participate, as the web platform has been developed for data collection in English.",NO,COVID-19,,"An abnormal CPET due to either decreased respiratory capacity, excessive dyspneoa, deconditioning or breathing disorder, A descriptive analysis of all evaluation criteria will be performed on the total population and on subgroups to be defined a posteriori according to the sample (December 2023).",,,Association pour la Complementarite des Connaissances et des Pratiques de la Pneumologie,"Menarini Group|Hylab, Grenoble|AstraZeneca",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,1200,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,ACCPP-PROT2022-01,2022-07-15,2023-12-31,2023-12-31,2022-09-08,,2024-05-21,"Hosp.

Beside the prescription of some promising drugs as chloroquine, azithromycin, antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat) and immunomodulating agents (steroids, tocilizumab), in our patients with mild to moderate pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 we planned a randomize study to evaluate, respect the best available therapy (BAT), the use of autohemotherapy treatement with an oxygen/ozone (O3) gaseous mixture as adjuvant therapy.Design. Multicentric, randomized study.Participants. Clinical presentations are based upon clinical phenotypes identified by the Italian Society of Emergency and Urgency Medicine (SIMEU - Società Italiana di Medicina di Emergenza-Urgenza) and patients that meet criteria of phenotypes 2 to 4 were treat with best available therapy (BAT), and randomized to receive or not O3-autohemotherapy.Main outcome measures.

However, these preliminary data are derived from a selective group of patients with long COVID after critical COVID-19. We aim to explore the generalizability of these findings in patients with long COVID with dyspnea and fatigue, irrespective of the severity of their acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.Primary objective: To assess if pulmonary fibroblast activity, measured by \[68Ga\]FAPI-46 PET/CT, is higher in patients with current long COVID dyspnea and fatigue compared to patients with resolved complaints.Study design: This is a ZonMw funded single centre prospective observational cohort study of long COVID-19 patients with dyspnea and fatigue.Study population: We will recruit 60 adult long COVID patients (aged \>20 years) of which 30 have complaints of dyspnea and fatigue and compare them to 30 patients with resolved complaints and healthy controls.Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is FAP expression in the lung measured by \[68Ga\]FAPI-46 PET/CT.

The most frequent symptoms of Lonf-term COVID are fatigue and dyspnea. But two classes of symptoms have been received scientific attention: the musculoskeletal pain and oral complaints related to Long COVID, mainly xerostomia and burning mouth.

In addition, depending on the suddenness and intensity of this ""COVID-19 wave"", these personnel have been more or less trained and sometimes exposed due to the dire lack of protective equipment.
